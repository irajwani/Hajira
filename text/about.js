`Hi there! I’m Hajira Maryam, a nomadic journalist switching between Turkey and Pakistan. About me, well, pursuing journalism is something that I stumbled upon–and no, it was not an accident, I stumbled upon it willingly.

My professional journey started at the age of 21 while working as a student assistant at the Civilization Studies Centre at Bahcesehir University. There I worked as a researcher for a documentary about World War One in collaboration with the Turkish Radio and Television (TRT). At that time, I was a clueless student, studying business (a boring degree!) and working on the side to make ends meet, but that experience granted me exposure into the news media industry.

After my undergraduate studies, I got an internship at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) where I focused on reports related to sustainable financing and Islamic Banking. It was there that I also realized that the corporate entities were not meant for me, so after my internship, I turned back to TRT, and viola! I ended up working with their English news broadcaster, TRT World.

At TRT World, I worked for three years as a researcher and an events coordinator. The job description may make you fall into a slumber of sleep but it was an exciting period, considering that I had stepped into a news media platform which provided me with an opportunity to learn news media skills–so I did that. Wrote features, TV training and understood the day-to-day happenings of a newsroom.

Then my masters happened! Oh, was that a point to remember. I did the unthinkable by conducting an online crowdfund and raising my tuition on an online platform to fund my education at Oxford University. The whole experience was the best I could ask for with all the hiccups on the way. I did get into the Financial Times as an intern for their opinions team but COVID-19 did not let that last.

Finally, I came back to Pakistan in 2021 and have been freelancing since. I have worked with TRT World, Deutsche Welle, Al Jazeera, Foreign Policy, and a lot more outlets. My experience includes working as a TV reporter and a writer. And my beats focus on human rights, the environment, international relations, and everyday political mishaps.

So yeah, please have the liberty to check my website and I hope you enjoy it–I guess!`
